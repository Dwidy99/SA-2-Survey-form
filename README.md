# Survey Form

This project is to fulfill the Responsive Web Design certification from the Free Code Camp course.

## Container Section

there is a container section that wraps around the two parent elements as follows:

### Header Section

1. In this section only contains the title text which is positioned in the center.

### Form Section (#survey-form)

1. In this section it is a parent that wraps the input elements that have been set using the CSS Grid, the column size is auto fit and the minmax is 1fr so it will automatically respond when the screen is enlarged or reduced (including loaded on the mobile browser).
